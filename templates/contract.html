                <p class="mb-6">
                    The standard of a Siberian is a barrel shaped body. They are very muscular and active cats with dog-like demeanor, not very vocal. The first year they gain weight quickly, with males reaching 8-12 lbs. and by maturity anywhere from 12 to 20 lbs. A female is roughly 8-12 lbs.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-6">
                    We require our kitten to be altered prior to 6 months of age. As proof of the alteration, we do require a written notification from the attending veterinarian that includes the MICROCHIP number which will correspond with the microchip number on the contract.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-6">
                    Siberian's Fel d 1 level fluctuates with the hormone levels, so when a cat is nursing, pregnant or in heat, the Fel d 1 level rises and can affect allergy symptoms in allergy sufferers. Therefore, it is very beneficial for the family to have the kitten altered as soon as possible. We understand that each veterinary practice has their preference of when to alter, which we understand.
