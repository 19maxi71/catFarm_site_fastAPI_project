                This guide covers key topics and answers common questions for the coming weeks and months. For any questions, text me at 267-538-8590 or call in an emergency. While we previously met families in person to discuss all concerns and get acquainted, we've adapted to changing times.

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-pink-800 mb-4">SAFE HEAVEN</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    When bringing home a new kitten, expect it to be nervous and miss its mother and siblings. Please provide a towel for sleeping, plus food, water, and a litter box.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    To help the kitten adjust, place it in your smallest room (the smaller the better) with food and water <strong>SEPARATED</strong> from the litter box. After an hour, you may enter, play with, and hold the kitten; keep it in your arms to build trust rather than letting it roam.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    After one hour, return the kitten to the litter box and close the door. Allow approximately 15 minutes before repeating this process.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    By the third day, the kitten should begin seeking your attention. At this stage, you may open the door and permit the kitten to explore independently; it has already been learned how to return to the litter box when necessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the kitten has adjusted to its new environment and you prefer not to keep a litter box in your bathroom, purchase an additional box and place it in the designated permanent area. Keep the original box in its current location for about a month to ensure the kitten consistently uses the new box.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-pink-800 mb-4">NIBBLING</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Nibbling should not be permitted. If redirecting your kitten to a toy is ineffective, it may be appropriate to gently scruff the kitten, lift it by the scruff, firmly say "<strong>NO!</strong>," place the kitten on the floor, and then ignore it for a while.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    While nibbling may not cause harm now, kittens eventually mature and will develop stronger hunting behaviors. Then nibbling won't be so cute anymore. Cats love attention, so if you teach them there is a consequence for their naughty behavior, they will soon learn.
                </p>
                <p class="font-semibold">
                    It is important NOT TO PICK UP YOUR CAT BY THE SCRUFF ONCE IT IS OLDER THAN EIGHT (8) MONTHS. Teach it the basics while it's little.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-pink-800 mb-4">BATHING</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    You can bathe your kitten, but I suggest wiping them with a wet towel. Gently rub the cat down with the damp towel, taking away the surface dander that causes the allergies.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Some cat owners prefer to buy wipes in a pet store, but, honestly, they have nothing special in them (producers cannot put anything on them because it will harm a cat when it licks its fur). Give a small treat after you wipe your kitten and after 2nd bath they will look forward to it.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-pink-800 mb-4">FOOD</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Feed your kitten 3 times a day. I recommend Royal Canin Mother & Baby cat food for kittens. It is very high quality and has all the nutrients they need. You can buy it at Petco or online.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Do not give your kitten cow's milk. It will cause diarrhea. If you want to give milk, buy cat milk from the pet store.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Do not give people food. It can cause serious health issues. No chocolate, onions, garlic, grapes, raisins, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fresh water should always be available. Change it daily.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-pink-800 mb-4">LITTER BOX</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Use clumping litter. I recommend Fresh Step or World's Best Cat Litter. Clean the box daily. If you have multiple cats, have multiple boxes.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    If your kitten has accidents outside the box, clean it thoroughly with enzymatic cleaner (available at pet stores). Regular cleaners don't remove the scent that attracts cats back to the same spot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Never punish your kitten for accidents. They are learning and it takes time.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-pink-800 mb-4">SCRATCHING</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Provide scratching posts. Cats need to scratch to keep their claws healthy and to mark territory. Buy tall posts that they can stretch on.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    If they scratch furniture, gently redirect them to the post. You can also use double-sided tape on furniture temporarily.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Keep claws trimmed. You can do this yourself with cat nail clippers or have a groomer do it.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-pink-800 mb-4">PLAYTIME</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Kittens need lots of playtime to stay healthy and happy. Play with interactive toys like laser pointers, feather wands, and balls.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Play multiple short sessions throughout the day rather than one long session.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This also helps prevent behavioral issues from boredom.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-pink-800 mb-4">VETERINARIAN</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Take your kitten to the vet within 72 hours of pickup. They need to check for health issues and start vaccinations.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Keep up with vaccination schedule. Kittens need multiple rounds of vaccines.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Discuss spaying/neutering. This should be done around 6 months of age.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Regular check-ups are important for preventive care.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-pink-800 mb-4">BEHAVIOR</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Kittens are curious and will get into everything. Keep dangerous items out of reach.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    They may be shy at first. Give them time to adjust and don't force interaction.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Some kittens are more active than others. Respect their individual personality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have concerns about behavior, consult a veterinarian or animal behaviorist.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-pink-800 mb-4">HEALTH CONCERNS</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Watch for signs of illness: lethargy, not eating, vomiting, diarrhea, sneezing, discharge from eyes/nose.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Contact vet immediately if you notice any concerning symptoms.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Siberian cats can have some health issues. Regular vet visits help catch problems early.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Keep emergency vet number handy.
