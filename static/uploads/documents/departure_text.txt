DEPARTURE INSTRUCTION
S
Welcome to the Siberian cat world
 and congratulations on the new family member!
This guide covers key topics and answers common questions for the coming weeks and months. For any questions, text me at 267-538-8590 or call in an emergency. While we previously met families in person to discuss 
all 
concerns and get acquainted, we've adapted to changing times.
SAFE HEAVEN
When bringing home a new kitten, 
expect
 it to be nervous and miss its mother and siblings. 
Please provide 
a towel for sleeping, plus food, water, and a litter box. 
To help the kitten adjust, place it in your smallest room 
(the smaller the better) 
with food and water 
SEPARATED 
from the litter box. After an hour, 
you may 
enter, play with, and hold the kitten; keep it in your arms to build trust rather than letting it roam.
 
After one hour, return the kitten to the litter box and close the door. Allow approximately 15 minutes before repeating this process. 
By the third day, the kitten should begin seeking your attention. At this stage, you may open the door and permit the kitten to explore independently; it has 
already 
been learned how to return to the litter box when necessary.
Once the kitten ha
s 
adjusted to 
its 
new environment and you prefer not to keep a litter box in your bathroom, purchase an additional box and place it in the designated permanent area. Keep the original box in its current location for about a month to ensure the kitten consistently uses the new box.
NIBBLING
Nibbling should not be permitted. If redirecting your kitten to a toy is ineffective, it may be appropriate to gently scruff the kitten, lift it by the scruff, 
firmly
 say "
NO!
,
" place the kitten on the floor, and then
 ignore it for a while
. While nibbling may not cause harm 
now,
 kittens eventually mature and 
will 
develop stronger hunting behaviors.
 Then nibbling won’t be so cute anymore. Cats love attention, so if you teach them there is a consequence for their naughty behavior, they will soon learn. 
It is important 
NOT TO PICK UP YOUR CAT BY THE SCRUFF ONCE IT IS OLDER THAN EIGHT (8) MONTHS. Teach it the basics while it’s little.
BATHING
You can bathe your kitten, but I suggest wiping them with a wet towel. Gently rub the cat down with the damp towel, taking away the surface dander that causes the allergies. Some 
cat owners prefer to buy wipes in a pet store, but, honestly, they have nothing special in them (producers cannot put anything on them because it will harm a cat when it licks its fur). Give a small treat after you wipe your kitten and after 2
nd
 
time
 they will be waiting for their wiping session!
HEPA purifiers are a must if you have severe allergies.
For pantaloons (and Siberians are famous for their pantaloons!), in case there’s poop stuck, use a small flea comb.
If you st
il
l feel the need to bathe your cat, please make sure THERE
’
S NOT WATER FROM THE NECK UP! There’s a reason God gave cats tilted ears, so rain doesn’t get in them when they are outdoors. There are real stories about bathing time going wrong with not happy ending. I always do reverse scruff, so my entire palm is covering the head and there’s no chance ears are getting wet. 
DO NOT  USE FLEA AND TICK SHAMPOO
 nor do you use flea and tick protection from anywhere BUT your vets. There are some horror stories about seizures/collapsing cats from using Hartz and 
Sargents
 products so be safe and use only Veterinarian recommended products. 
LITTER
We use clumping litter 
similar to
 Tidy Cat. If you want to change it, please go gradually.  
Use about 2 inches of litter—kittens have short legs, so keep it shallow enough for easy digging
; also, there shouldn’t be too much litter to refill a 
digged
 up hole. 
If your kitten is too lazy to dig or likes to wait until the last minute to go 
without 
time for digging, then while it’s still a kitten, you 
have to
 be mama and clean it up. 
 It’s not easy being adorable.
FOOD
We recommend raw meat or high-quality canned cat food like Canidae, 
Fromms
, or Wellness, but avoid fish as it affects pH balance and can cause crystals. High ash content in dog food may also cause crystals, so 
KEEP YOUR CAT AWAY FROM DOG FOOD. Cats’ food does not have the fat content that dog food does (the average ash in cat food is no more than 7%).
Canned food typically supplies essential vitamins and minerals, while raw meat mainly provides moisture and protein; kittens need calcium for bone development. Siberian cats experience rapid growth during their first year and may continue growing until around five years of age.
Kittens up to 8 months old must have wet food 2 times a day together with access to a bowl of dry kibble all the time to munch on. Please keep dry food away from the water bowl, as wet kibbles can get moldy (remember this when shopping for bowls that are stuck together, - cats prefer their water away from food). 
When shopping for food, remember that Grain Free means it is hold together not by grain, but by potato and rice starch, which turn into carb
ohydrates. Cats
 cannot 
proceed with carb
ohydrate
s.  Some cat food, including Royal Cannin Kitten, are surprisingly high in carbs.
It’s important to check your  kitten is eating regularly, especially during transition period. A kitten/cat will get hepatic lipidosis (a fatty liver) if they do not eat for 3 days. 
We use stainless steel water bowls. Plastic bowls absorb bacteria and kittens can develop chin acne, which is hard to get rid of.
If the kittens refuse to eat during transition period, you need to use syringe. Always put it on the side of its mouth, never straight on! This will prevent aspiration. 
If you see a vet or 
tech
 applying liquid dewormer directly, ask them to put it on the side of the mouth instead.
TOYS
PURRfect
 Cat Toys Leather Bouncer should only be used under supervision. Kittens may chew off and swallow leather pieces, risking dangerous blockages that require 
extensive 
surgery. Likewise, supervise small children using this toy to prevent injuries to their own or kittens' eyes.
TEETH
As your baby gets new teeth 
the gums may appear red and inflamed. It is important to monitor the condition of the gums regularly, as cats and kittens are particularly prone to gingivitis. It is recommended to use a piece of gauze wrapped around your finger once a week to clean the teeth: gently swipe downward from the upper gum line and upward from the lower gum line.
NAILS
Trim the tips every other week. Make sure not to nick them or you will never be able to clip your 
cat 
nails again! 
EARS
Kittens don’t clean their ears and sometimes 
may get wax buildup on their upper ears. Use a facial swab with organic vinegar (
squeeze
 out excess
!
) to clean it, but 
DON’T LET VINEGAR
 
ENTER THE EAR CANAL! 
Once kitten
 starts to
 groom
 itself
,
 it won’t need assistance anymore
.
WORMING
All cats and dogs, including kittens and puppies, commonly have parasites. Always use vet-recommended treatments; avoid over-the-counter products. Dewormers 
may cause temporary loose stools as they remove parasites, but this usually resolves within a week. Be patient and only consult your vet if symptoms persist or worsen.
 
At this stage, taking anti-diarrhea medication can be harmful, as it may prevent the expulsion of parasites and lead to toxicity.
BRUSHSING
We recommend once a week brushing. It will not only keep the coat shiny and healthy looking but also will alter you when the molt is starting. Spring and Fall are the time when the molt starts (depending on the temperature of your house). Once it starts, you will need to brush  every day, until you  no longer see undercoat coming out. If you don’t get it on time, you may have your cat shaved, as it mats close to the skin. It’s dangerous to cut it off as you can easily cut/nick your cat.
Use an appropriate brush/comb that goes through your cat undercoat. The Siberians are famous for their lustrous three undercoats, and you must reach them all the way down.
If you are in a habit of brushing weekly, it will help your cat with hair balls.
PET INSURANCE
Pet insurance is highly recommended. There are many to choose from, 
with different deductibles etc. W
ith veterinary care costs rising every year
, it will keep you and your cat on the safe side. 
This is a lot of stuff to go 
over
 and it may look overwhelming, but I want to give answers to your questions before they even arise. You are the best parent to your new baby, so use your intuition and common sense. I’m always here for you, working together with the most experienced breeders, and I will try to address all your concerns.  Your Trusted Vet is your greatest asset as well.

Vaccination Recommendation
NOBIVAC FVRCP helps prevent Panleukopenia, Rhinotracheitis, and Calicivirus. Ask your vet about the pros and cons of live versus killed vaccines; some studies link killed vaccines to sarcoma (cancer).
FELINE LEUKEMIA VACCINATION: Currently, the risk of severe reaction or death from the vaccine outweighs the risk of contracting the disease. Until safer vaccines are available, our cats will remain indoors and avoid contact with FELV/FIV-positive cats.
RABIES VACCINE should be given based on your state laws. Your kitten doesn’t come with a rabies vaccine. Please ask your vet about MODIFIED LIVE rabies vaccine.
CORONAVIRUS – FIP results from a mutation of 
FCoV
 (coronavirus) and is not directly contagious between cats. About 85% of domestic cats are exposed to FECV, with roughly one-third shedding the virus. While 80–90% of cats test positive for coronavirus, only 5
%
–10% develop FIP. A positive 
for coronavirus 
blood test does not confirm FIP; diagnosis requires a FIP Virus 
RealPCT
 Test or identifying yellow abdominal fluid in wet FIP cases. Healthy cats typically fight off the virus. These statistics are widely available online.
Feeding Suggestions
Water must always be fresh and available in a BIG bowl (we suggest stainless steel)
Provide high-protein, low-carb dry food 
at all times
.
Feed raw meat or quality canned food (e.g., Canidae, 
Fromms
, Wellness) twice daily; avoid fish.
Do not give cow 
milk—
use goat milk if needed.
Danger:
STRINGS OF THREAD, HAIR TIES, RUBBER BANDS ARE VERY DANGEROUS. Cats cannot spit them out once they are on their tongue. Keep all dangerous items away!
MANY HOUSEHOLD PLANTS ARE HIGHLY TOXIC. It is important to identify which plants are hazardous (for example, Dieffenbachia, Aloe Vera, etc.). Carefully inspect all household plants prior to introducing a kitten into the home.
