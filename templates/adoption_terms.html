                <h2>1. Adoption Process</h2>
                <p>Adoption requests are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. We prioritize homes that can provide a loving, stable environment for our Siberian cats. The adoption process includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Initial application review</li>
                    <li>Home visit (virtual or in-person)</li>
                    <li>Reference checks</li>
                    <li>Adoption contract signing</li>
                    <li>Adoption fee payment</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>2. Adoption Fees</h2>
                <p>Our adoption fees vary based on the cat's age, health status, and special needs. Fees typically range from $200-$500 and include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Spaying/neutering</li>
                    <li>Initial vaccinations</li>
                    <li>Microchipping</li>
                    <li>Health certificate</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. Health Guarantee</h2>
                <p>All cats come with a 30-day health guarantee. If your adopted cat develops a serious health issue within 30 days of adoption, we will work with you to resolve the issue, which may include veterinary care reimbursement or, in rare cases, return of the cat.</p>

                <h2>4. Return Policy</h2>
                <p>If for any reason the adoption doesn't work out, you may return the cat within 30 days. We require that you contact us immediately if issues arise. Returned cats will be evaluated for health and behavior before being made available for adoption again.</p>

                <h2>5. Commitment Requirements</h2>
                <p>Adopters must commit to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Providing proper veterinary care</li>
                    <li>Maintaining a safe indoor environment</li>
                    <li>Not declawing the cat</li>
                    <li>Contacting us if rehoming becomes necessary</li>
                    <li>Allowing periodic follow-up check-ins</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>6. Data Privacy</h2>
                <p>Your personal information will be used solely for adoption processing and follow-up. We comply with CCPA regulations regarding data collection, use, and deletion. You may request deletion of your data at any time.</p>

                <h2>7. Agreement</h2>
                <p>By submitting an adoption application, you agree to these terms and conditions. You understand that adoption approval is at the discretion of LavanderCats Cat Farm and that we reserve the right to deny adoption requests that don't meet our standards for cat welfare.</p>
