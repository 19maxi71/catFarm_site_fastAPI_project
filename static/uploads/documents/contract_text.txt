Due to the controversy of the FELV/FIV vaccine we recommend that this vaccine should NOT be given to our kittens as they are not outdoor cats and should not 
encounter
 this. Our cats are not to be left 
outdoors, nor should they be exposed to cats with FELV/FIV. 
Whenever a vaccine is being administrated
,
 only ONE vaccine should be given at a time. Seller doesn’t guarantee kittens wellbeing due to adverse reactions to future vaccinations.
The Seller guarantees the kitten described above is free of FELV (Feline Leukemia) and FIV (Feline AIDS) at the time of shipment, pick-up or delivery. One kitten from each litter will have been tasted for FELV/FIV.

NOTE TO VETERINARIAN
Thank 
you in advance for your care and compassion 
for
 your new patient.
The standard
 of a Siberian is a barrel shaped body
. They are very muscular and active cats with 
dog
-
like 
demeanor
, not very vocal. The f
irst 
year they gain weight 
quickly
, with males reaching 8-12 
lbs.
 and 
by maturity  
  
anywhere from 12 to 20 lbs. 
A female is roughly 8-12 lbs.
We require our kitten to be altered prior to 6 months of age. As proof of the 
alteration,
 we do require 
a written notification
 
from the attending veterinarian that includes the MICROCHIP number
 which will 
  
correspond with the microchip number on the contract.
Siberian’s 
fel
 d 1 
level 
fluctuates
 with the hormone levels, so when a cat is nursing, 
pregnant
 or in heat
, the 
fe
l
 
d 1 level rises and can affect allergy symptoms in allergy sufferers. 
 Therefore, it is very beneficial for the family
 to have the kitten altered as soon as possible. We understand that each 
veterinary
 practice has their preference of when to alter
, which we understand. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I certify that I have rendered the kitten presented to me with microchip
 number____________________________________________________
i
ncapable of breeding by alteration/neu
tering. I also authorize the verification of this altering by phone call or correspondence.
